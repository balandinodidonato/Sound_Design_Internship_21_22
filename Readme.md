# Gamekit 3D Sound Design Internship 21/22 ReadMe

This Project is a fork of the Unity Technologies GameKit3D repository. It is being utilised to for the Sound Design Internship 21/22.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to produce the audio for the Unity 3D game kit level. The audio is to be fully procedural i.e. produced from scratch. This is facilitated by the Pure Data visual scripting language. Patches produced in Pure Data will be implemented into Unity using middleware such as WWise and converting created PD patches into Wwise plugins using the Heavy Compiler by Enzien Audio.

The created audio aims to be a realistic and more controllable option for the game audio. Demonstrating a gained understanding of procedural audio from research and experimentation while also gaining experience in a professional team setting and using professional version control methods.
